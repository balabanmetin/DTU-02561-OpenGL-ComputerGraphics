1.Phong shading is a appliation of phong lightning. If you consider each pixels' normal during phong lightning calculation, it is phong shading.

2. If you assign each polygon defined by vertices a normal, it is Gouraud's method. Calculations are done before rasterizing. 
If you assign each pixel a normal, it is Phong's method. Calculations are done after rasterizing (fragment shading). 
Gouraud's method is deceptively simple and Easy to compute as against Phong shading.

3. Unlike point light, rays are parallel to each other in directional light.

4. Yes. to make an analogy, the more rays your eyes reached to, the brighter you see where you look at.

5. Surfaces looks dull without it, somewhat like chalk. What we are missing are the highlights that we see reﬂected from shiny objects.

6. As shininess is increased, the reﬂected light is concentrated in a narrower region centered on the angle of a perfect reﬂector.

7.	Instead of computing reflection for every point on surface, we have replaced r*v component with n*h, where r is reflection and
h is halfway vector. It is a succesful and efficient technique when used on flat or curved surfaces.

8. In some cases, i.e. when modelView matrix makes non-uniform transformations, modelView matrix cannot be used to convert normal vectors
in object space to eye space coordinates. In such cases, normal matrix is used. It is equal to (M^-1)^T where is upper left 
3x3 matrix of modelView matrix. 

9. Eye space. Otherwise eye position dependent effects, such as specular lights would be harder to implement.
