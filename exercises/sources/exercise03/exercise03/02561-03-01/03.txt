1) Vertex attributes are spesific to that vertex: each attribute might differentiate from others. 
Unlike vertex attributes, uniform vertex variables are the same for each vertex in model. They can be changed in display function.

2-3-4) , a vertex shader will transform the representation of a vertex location from whatever coordinate system in which it is 
speciﬁed to a representation in clip coordinates for the rasterizer (2).Each invocation of the vertex shader outputs a vertex 
that then goes through primitive assembly and clipping before reaching the rasterizer. The rasterizer outputs fragments
for each primitive inside the clipping volume (4) . Each fragment invokes an execution of the fragment shader (3). Fragment 
shader assigns colors to fragments.

5) Yes it is possible. We need to output two color vectors from vertex shader: color1 and color2. By using uniform blendingValue,
we can blend two colors in fragment shader. Texturing is applied in fragment shader generally. This is because blending in 
fragment shader sounds more natural.
