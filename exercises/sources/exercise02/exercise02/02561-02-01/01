In exercise01, vertex elements are considered in 2D space so their positions are represented cartesian coordinates. 
On the other hand, in this exercise, vertex elements are in 3D space and their positions are represented in 
homogenous coordinates, which are vec4.
In display function, we describe model-view properties of our vision (camera). In this exercise, it is defined with
triplet of eye, at, up. LookAt() function, which takes an eye position, a position to look at, and an up vector, 
all in object space coordinates computes the inverse camera transform according to its parameters 
and multiplies it onto the current matrix stack.
